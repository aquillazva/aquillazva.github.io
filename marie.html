        <p class="main-topic">Marie is an original character in Persona 4 Golden who works as a Velvet Room assistant, helps the protagonist with online features and skill cards, and has the Aeon Social Link. When you first met Marie, you handed her the poem you found lying around the floor and she’s very quiet. Marie seems to have forgotten her memory which leads to your Social Links with her. A girl who doesn’t know anything about the world and doesn’t understand the meaning of having “friends”and “memorable memories”. </p>

        <h3 class="main-topic">Marie's Analysis</h3> 
        <img src="mariep4.gif"alt = "marie from persona 4"width="25%">
        <p class="main-topic">Marie from Persona 4 Golden is a divisive character whose analysis revolves around her initial tsundere-like personality and straight-forwardness.  A closed-off, sarcastic amnesiac, Marie's character arc focuses on finding her identity, expressing her emotions through poetry, and forming genuine connections with the Investigation Team, which ultimately helps her find peace in the present despite her tragic past. Marie is a pretty complex character who wants both love and friends. </p>
